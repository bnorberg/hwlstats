<h2>Humanities Writ Large</h2>
Humanities Writ Large is five-year initiative aimed at redefining the role of the humanities in undergraduate education.

The Humanities Writ Large initiative includes a series of related components:

<h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>
Humanities Writ Large aims to infuse the undergraduate experience with opportunities to conduct humanities research and thereby learn how humanities fields contribute valuable new knowledge through humanistic analysis, perspective and methods.

<h2>Emerging Humanities Networks</h2>
Emerging Networks are a culture change mechanism intended to shift humanities research towards broadly collaborative, interdisciplinary engagements in contrast to the largely solitary efforts that tend to characterize traditional humanities research.

<h2>Humanities Labs</h2>
Humanities Labs are multi-year programs designed around a theme and intended to drive change and innovation in our undergraduate humanities curriculum through new courses and student research opportunities.

<h2>Visiting Faculty Fellows</h2>
The Visiting Faculty Fellows program is intended to extend the practice of humanities research and education philosophically grounded at the undergraduate level into liberal arts colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

<h2>Bridge Appointments for New Faculty</h2>
The Humanities Writ Large grant provides resources to jump-start new hiring of teacher-scholars who embrace and champion our undergraduate-focused approach to humanities education and research.
